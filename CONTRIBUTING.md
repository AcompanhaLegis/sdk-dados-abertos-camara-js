# Introduction

This is the sdk that enables developers to easily make api requests to the [API Dados Abertos da Camara](https://dadosabertos.camara.leg.br/).

# Issues

When opening issues, try to make your self clear, give examples and/or code snippets. You can either write it in English (preferred) or Portguese, if there's further interest of people that can only understand one of these languages, let us know on the issue and we will try to translate it.

> If you would like to suggest some templates, go ahead, we didn't make time for it yet.

You can suggest implementations approaches, fixes, etc. Sometimes we need to make tough decisions on either implement something or not, but since the
project is open source, you can have your own fork within your more urgent or "refused" ideas.

:warning: Overall, be respectful while discussing the issues, it should be a friendly environment for anyone interested on the project.

## Before opening a PR

Make sure the linting and tests are passing, make sure you've implemented tests for you implementation and be aware that you need to communicate on the issue so we don't have multiple people working on the same issue.


# Code review process

The opened PRs will be reviewed by one of the main maintainers of the project, you will be able to check who's going to review it once they are assigned.
